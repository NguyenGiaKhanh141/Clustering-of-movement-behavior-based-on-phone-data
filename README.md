A [call detail record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record) (CDR) is a data record produced by a telephone exchange or other telecommunications equipment that documents the details of a telephone call or other telecommunications transaction (e.g., text message) that passes through that facility or device.

The questions you'll be exploring in this lab assignment using K-Means are: exactly how useful is telephone metadata? It must have some use, otherwise, the government wouldn't have invested however many millions they did into it secretly collecting it from phone carriers. Also what kind of intelligence can you extract from CDR metadata besides its face value?

The record contains various attributes of the call, such as time, duration, completion status, source number, and destination number. It is the automated equivalent of the paper toll tickets that were written and timed by operators for long-distance calls in a manual telephone exchange.

The dataset we've curated for you contains call records of 10 people, tracked over the course of 3 years. Your job in this assignment is to find out where each of these people likely live and where they work at!
